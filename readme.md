#ephox-editors-for-drupal

##What does this do?
`ephox-editors-for-drupal` provides a quick way to integrate Ephox's editor products (Textbox.io and EditLive!) into Drupal 7 via the `wysiwyg` module.

The Drupal community has a convenient way to integrate a wysiwyg editor into content authoring forms via the popular `wysiwyg` module.  Ephox Editors for Drupal adds support for Textbox.io and EditLive! to the `wysiwyg` module so you can leverage the power of Ephox's editors while creating content in Drupal!

In addition to enhancing the wysiwyg module, Ephox Editors for Drupal also includes a separate module that allows you to leverage the *Automatic Image Upload* feature of Textbox.io and EditLive!.  With Automatic Image Upload enabled, our editors automatically upload local images to Drupal when you paste or insert them into your content - no more uploading images before you use them in content!

##Requirements
* Drupal 7
* `wysiwyg` module (https://www.drupal.org/project/wysiwyg)
* A supported Ephox editor product
  * Textbox.io 1.2+
  * EditLive! 9+

*Note: In its current form this code will not work with earlier releases of Drupal.  If you need to use this with earlier releases of Drupal please contact us at <mailto:support@ephox.com>.*
